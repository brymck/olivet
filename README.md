Olivet
======

Olivet is a serious take on quality control.

> When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will
> sit on His glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and
> He will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the
> sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep on His right and the goats on
> His left.
>
> Then the King will say to those on His right, "Come, you who are blessed by
> my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
> world.  For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and
> you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in, I was
> naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison
> and you visited Me."
>
> Then He will say to those on His left, "Depart from Me, you who are cursed,
> into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry
> and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to
> drink, I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did
> not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me."
>
> And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal
> life.
